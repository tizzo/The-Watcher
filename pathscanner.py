"""pathscanner.py Scans paths and stores them in a sqlite3 database

You can use PathScanner to detect changes in a directory structure. For
efficiency, only creations, deletions and modifications are detected, not
moves.

Modified files are detected by looking at the mtime.

Instructions:
- Use initial_scan() to build the initial database.
- Use scan() afterwards, to get the changes.
- Use scan_tree() (which uses scan()) to get the changes in an entire
  directory structure.
- Use purge_path() to purge all the metadata for a path from the database.
- Use (add|update|remove)_files() to add/update/remove files manually (useful
  when your application has more/faster knowledge of changes)

TODO: unit tests (with *many* mock functions). Stable enough without them.
