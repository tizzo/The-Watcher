"""fsmonitor.py Cross-platform file system monitor

How it works:
- Uses inotify on Linux (kernel 2.6.13 and higher)
- Uses FileSystemWatcher on Windows (TODO)
- Uses FSEvents on Mac OS X (10.5 and higher)
- Falls back to polling

A persistent mode is also supported, in which all metadata is stored in a
database. This allows you to even track changes when your program wasn't
running.

Only FSEvents supports looking back in time. For Linux and Windows this means
that the manual scanning procedure will be used instead until we have caught
up.

To make this class work consistently, less critical features that are only
available for specific file system monitors are abstracted away. And other
features are emulated.
It comes down to the fact that FSMonitor's API is very simple to use and only
supports 5 different events: CREATED, MODIFIED, DELETED, MONITORED_DIR_MOVED
and DROPPED_EVENTS. The last 2 events are only triggered for inotify and
FSEvents.

This implies that the following features are not available through FSMonitor:
- inotify:
  * auto_add: is always assumed to be True (FSEvents has no setting for this)
  * recursive: is always assumed to be True (FSEvents has no setting for this)
  * IN_ACCESS, IN_CLOSE_WRITE, IN_CLOSE_NOWRITE, IN_OPEN, IN_DELETE_SELF and
    IN_IGNORED event aren't supported (FSEvents doesn't support this)
  * IN_UNMOUNT is also not supported because FSEvents' equivalent
    (kFSEventStreamEventFlagUnmount) isn't supported in Python
- FSEvents:
  * sinceWhen: is always set to kFSEventStreamEventIdSinceNow (inotify has no
    setting for this)
  * kFSEventStreamEventFlagMount: is ignored (inotify doesn't support this)
And the following features are emulated:
- FSEvents:
  * inotify's mask, which allows you to listen only to certain events
